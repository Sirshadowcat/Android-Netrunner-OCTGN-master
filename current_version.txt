2.1.11||
======New Version Information======

This version adds some nice efficiency improvements. Now all your face-down cards will come in automatically peeked-at.

Also turn end will also trigger the OCTGN-built-in turn change, which should make it more obvious who's turn it is.

Finally, fixed some minor bugs.
